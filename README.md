## Installation
The bot can be run using Python or Docker.

### Python Script
Run locally:
1. Clone this repository, cd into it, and install dependancies:
```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Prem-ium/BingRewards.git
   cd BingRewards
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your `.env` file (See below and example for options)
3. Run the script:
```sh
   python main.py
```

### Docker Container
View on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nelsondane/bing-rewards)
1. Download and install Docker on your system
2. Configure your `.env` file (See below and example for options)
3. To start the bot using our prebuilt images:
 ```sh
   docker run -it --env-file ./.env --restart unless-stopped --name bing-rewards nelsondane/bing-rewards:<tag>
   ```
   To build the image yourself, cd into the repository and run:
   ```sh
   docker build -t bing-rewards .
   ```
   Then start the bot with:
   ```sh
   docker run -it --env-file ./.env --restart unless-stopped --name bing-rewards bing-rewards
   ```
   Both methods will create a new container called `bing-rewards`. Make sure you have the correct path to your `.env` file you created.

4. Let the bot log in and begin working. DO NOT PRESS `CTRL-c`. This will kill the container and the bot. To exit the logs view, press `CTRL-p` then `CTRL-q`. This will exit the logs view but let the bot keep running.

You can also open `DockerQuickstart.bat` in a text editor, edit the exisitng path in the file with your own of the BingRewards folder directory and run it to quickly stop and start docker container instances.

## Donations
I've been working on this project for a few months now, and I'm really happy with how it's turned out. It's also been a helpful tool for users to earn some extra money with Bing Rewards. I'm currently working on adding new features to the script and working on other similar programs to generate passive income. I'm also working on making the script more user-friendly and accessible to a wider audience.

I'm accepting donations through BuyMeCoffee or GitHub Sponsors. Any amount you can donate will be greatly appreciated.

Your donations will help me to cover the costs of hosting the project, developing new features, and marketing the project to a wider audience.
Thank you for your support!
## Helper(s)
You can use this Selenium IDE script to help create new Microsoft Accounts slightly faster. (Semi-Automation, captcha and email verification manual):
You can find the script in the [Selenium-IDE-Scripts/Bing](https://github.com/Prem-ium/Selenium-IDE-Scripts/tree/master/Bing) directory of my Selenium IDE Project(s) repository.
## Earning Potential:

Conservatively calculating potential points/earnings per month using this bot w/ a lvl 2 account:

PC Searches: (150 * 30) = 4500

Mobile Searches: (100 * 30) = 3000

Edge Bonus: (20*30) = 600

Daily Sets: (30*30) = 900


This adds up to 9000 points, conservatively (not accounting for streak bonuses or more activities which usually net very high, random amount of points), which ends up being a minimum of $6.92/per month per account on level 2. $34.61/ per month with an instance of 5 level 2 reward accounts.

## Notes:

- This bot uses the new $1.00 = 1300 points conversion rate. Older Bing Reward accounts may have the old conversion rate of $1.00 = 1050 points. As well as â‚¬1.00 = 1500 points conversion rate for Euro based Bing Reward accounts.
